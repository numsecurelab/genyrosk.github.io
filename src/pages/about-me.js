          Barcelona is my hometown and I'm an avid fan of our football team.
          Visca el BarÃ§a! ðŸ”µðŸ”´

          If time is money and markets value efficiency, then automation is all about improving
          efficiency by saving time. In today's words: <span style={{fontSize: `18px`}}>ðŸ¤– = ðŸ’¸</span>.
          I thus believe that if something can be automated, then it <b>must</b> be
          automated. At some point. Somewhat. Perhaps.

          I can speak 7 languages: Russian, Spanish, French, English,
          Catalan, German and Mandarin. Although, to be honest, it's been a while
          since I last spoke Chinese. It's on my bucket list to get back
          to speaking it regularly.

          Education-wise: I went to a french school and later graduated in
          Computer and Information Engineering from the University of Cambridge in 2018.
          During my Cambridge years I developed a deep love for programming and
          took part in numerous hackathons (coding competitions).
          Winning one of them landed me a trip to Silicon Valley !
          I also took a keen interest in ML techniques and built neural
          networks using Tensorflow.

          The purpose of this blog is educational. What motivated me to start it
          was the desire to share interesting insights and knowledge about
          Python and Data Science.
