      <p>At a glance, here's a short collection of facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I can speak 7 languges: Russian, Spanish, French, English,
          Catalan, German and Mandarin. Although, to be honest, it's been a while
          since I last spoke Chinese. It's on my bucket list to get back
          to speaking it regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
          I grew up in Barcelona and I'm an avid FCBarcelona fan. Visca el Bar√ßa!
        </li>
        <li>
          Education-wise: I went to a french school and later graduated in
          Computer and Information Engineering from the University of Cambridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          During my Cambridge years I developed a deep love for programming and
          took part in numerous hackathons (coding competitions).
          Winning one of them landed me a trip to Silicon Valley !

          The purpose of this blog is educational. What motivated me to start it
          was the desire to share interesting insights and knowledge about 
          Python and Data Science.
