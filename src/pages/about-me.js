      <p>
        Hey there ! Welcome to my site. I am a Software Engineer and Data
        Scientist and you just stumbled upon the place where I like to share my
        posts about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and a few other
        things that I am passionate about.
      </p>
      <p>Favourite tech: Python, React, GatsbyJS and Docker.</p>
      {/* üíªüêç */}
      {/* <p>
        Early in my career, as a graduate engineer with a penchant for deep
        learning, I focused on researching, building and productionising ML
        models, a.k.a. curve fitting without domain knowledge. Later I worked in
        Data Science consulting, focusing on distributed cloud infrastructure on
        AWS and a data-processing-heavy tech stack composed of Docker, Airflow
        and Spark.

      {/* <p>
        For me machine learning goes hand in hand with automation and I simply
        follow the well known emoji equation{' '}
        <span style={{ fontSize: `18px` }}>‚ûïü§ñ = üí∏</span>. If something can be
        automated, then it has to be automated. At some point. Somewhat. If time
        allows perhaps... it really depends.

          To quote Jeremy Kepner, Head and Founder of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center:

      {/* <blockquote>
          The power of neural networks is they don‚Äôt require you to a priori state
          what the inputs can be. They can be anything.
          People have said "neural networks, machine learning - it‚Äôs just curve fitting".  <br/>
          Yes, but it‚Äôs <b style={{fontWeight:`1000`, textDecoration:`underline`}}>curve fitting without domain knowledge</b>.
          Domain knowledge is so costly and expensive to create, that having a
          general system is really powerful.
