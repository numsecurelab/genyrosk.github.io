Later I worked in\n        Data Science consulting, focusing on distributed cloud infrastructure on\n        AWS and a data-processing-heavy tech stack composed of Docker, Airflow\n        and Spark.\n      </p> */}\n      {/* <p>\n        For me machine learning goes hand in hand with automation and I simply\n        follow the well known emoji equation{' '}\n        <span style={{ fontSize: `18px` }}>‚ûïü§ñ = üí∏</span>.
