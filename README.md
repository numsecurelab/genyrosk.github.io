## ðŸš€ My personal blog

Who would have thought that I would one day become a blogger ? The things Python makes people do these days...

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

I built this blog using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). To get started:

- **For most developers: [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).**
