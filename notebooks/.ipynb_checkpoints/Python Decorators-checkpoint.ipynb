    "Whether you are a beginner or an advanced programmer, there are many reasons why you should choose Python for your next coding project. Python is a scripted language with an almost stupidly simple syntax, it is easy to learn and powerful to use. One of the main reasons that ~~I love~~ people love Python is that is offers quite a few clear metaphors for doing certain things. One of these things involves wrapping functions with some repetitively used code. And so, in your quest to becoming a true Pythonista lie a type function that will help you improve and streamline your code: **decorators**. "
