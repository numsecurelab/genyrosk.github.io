    "One of the most misunderstood and glossed over capabilities of Python iterators lies at the core of what an interator is under the hood: a (somewhat special) generator. Whether you are familiar with Python generators or you have only heard a thing or two about them, allow me to summarise the 2 main properties of generator functions: \n",

    "Notice how we're using the special `yield` statement instead of the typical `return`. This is done on purpose: `generator_func` is a function while `generator_inst` is a generator instance, the 'true' generator if you like. The purpose of a generator function is to build the generator while the generator instance is the actual object that is going to run the code that we wrote. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can trace an analogy with classes: everything starts with the class definition, which describes how different parts of it work together, and when called returns an instance of itself that holds all the inner methods and variables. In short, class definitions are meant to define and build, while class instances are meant to be built and executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a generator instance is not a value: it's a mapped computation. We can check it like so:   \n",
