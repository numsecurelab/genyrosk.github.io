    "Notice how we're using the special `yield` statement instead of the typical `return`. This is done on purpose: `generator_func` is a function while `generator_instance` is a generator instance, the 'true' generator if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a generator function is to build the generator instance, while the generator instance is the actual object that is going to run the specified code inside of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because, as we will see more in detail later, generators are **stateful**. Thus we need to initialize an instance of this generator in its initial state, that will change everytime we make call it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can trace an analogy with classes: everything starts with the class definition, which describes how different parts of it work together, and when called returns an instance of itself that holds all the inner methods and variables. In short, class definitions are meant to define and build, while class instances are meant to be built and executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a generator instance is not a value: it's a mapped computation. We can check it like so:   \n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    ">>> generator_func\n",
    "<function __main__.generator_func()>\n",
    ">>> generator_instance\n",
    "<generator object generator at 0x1111401a8>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the generator instance is an object located at certain memory address. From now on we'll refer to the generator instance simply as a generator. Albeit, don't be suprised if the term 'generator' is used to refer to the generator function as well. "

    "`yield` is a statment, i.e. a syntactic expression, that specifies the value that a generator returns, or, more precisely, the value that the generator __yields__, while `next` is a special Python function that summons the generator's inner code to execute until it encounters a `yield` statment, at which point it simply returns (yields) the specified value. \n",
